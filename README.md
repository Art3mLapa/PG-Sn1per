# PG-Sn1per
This is a free roblox account scrapper, or in simple terms, a program that finds old accounts with your desired item.
This program uses an automated and modified "ID surfing" method when a number is randomly generated, the existence of an account is checked - the number of followers (optional) and the presence of the desired thing. The program has a good configuration, open source, a clear interface and all this is free.
