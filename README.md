This is code for pging in roblox
The code works on the principle of the pging method - a digital method, when short and random ids are entered into the profile link to find an old and light account. I automated the algorithm for finding such accounts and added a useful feature - a filter by things, to find rich accounts or accounts with the thing you need.
