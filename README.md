# PG-Sn1per.
This is code for pging in roblox
The code works on the principle of the pging method - a digital method, when short and random ids are entered into the profile link to find an old and light account. I automated the algorithm for finding such accounts and added a useful feature - a filter by items, to find rich accounts or accounts with the item you need.
in the future I plan to make another filter that will not let verified accounts through, if this repo has 5 stars or more - then I will update the project and create new ones!
